# Activity Summary for 11/6/2025

## 4:04:51 PM
The file `c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\project.ino` primarily handles the overall application structure, UI creation, and initial setup.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:05:58 PM** marks the initial state in this log, setting up an Arduino project with numerous includes for WiFi, HTTP, JSON, and LVGL for UI. It defines placeholder WiFi credentials, initializes a LilyGo AMOLED display, and creates a `lv_tileview` with three main tiles (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`). Tile #1 is populated with a 7-day weather forecast using `WeatherForecastElement` objects with example data. Tile #2 displays "Welcome to the jungle" and supports a dark/light mode toggle. A boot screen sequence and WiFi connection attempt are also set up in `setup()`.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:28:57 PM** to **3:29:20 PM**: The `connect_wifi()` call in `setup()` is commented out, indicating it was temporarily disabled. Tile #3 in the UI creation gains a label, initially with "Welcome to the jungle", then "Historical ", and finally "Historical view", suggesting the start of a historical data view.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:29:45 PM**: The label text for Tile #2 is changed from "Welcome to the jungle" to "Graph", changing its purpose. A new header `#include "Drop.h"` is added, and a new static variable `static Dropdown<std::string>* dropdown_menu;` is introduced, although with a temporary typo in the declaration.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:30:16 PM**: The typo in the `dropdown_menu` declaration is corrected.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:34:11 PM**: The `connect_wifi()` call in `setup()` is re-confirmed as commented out.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:39:43 PM** to **3:40:07 PM**: The `Drop.h` include and `dropdown_menu` declaration are re-added and then corrected, indicating an iterative attempt to integrate a dropdown feature.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:40:34 PM**: An attempt is made to instantiate `dropdown_menu` within the Tile #3 UI setup: `dropdown_menu = new Dropdown<string>()`.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:41:23 PM** to **3:41:38 PM**: The instantiation of `dropdown_menu` in Tile #3 is reverted, and both the `dropdown_menu` declaration and the `#include "Drop.h"` are removed, effectively abandoning or postponing the dropdown menu feature.

The file `c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\WeatherForecastElement.cpp` handles the visual representation and positioning of individual weather forecast components.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:11:29 PM** establishes the class, creating `ScaleableLabel` objects for temperature, location, time, and symbol text, along with a generic `symbol` image. It includes functions to set values (temperature, location, time, weather type) and to position/size these elements. The initial positioning for temperature text is `(x + 0.225 * size) * xSize` and the `symbol` image zoom is `0.9f`.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:14:42 PM**: Adjustments are made to the positioning of `temperature_text` (x-offset changed to `0.4 * size`) and the `symbol` zoom factor (reduced to `0.7f`).
*   **11/6/2025, 3:15:09 PM**: The horizontal positioning of the `symbol` and `temperature_text` are further adjusted, shifting the symbol to the left (`x - 0.2 * size`) and temperature text to the right (`x + 0.2 * size`).
*   **11/6/2025, 3:15:40 PM** to **3:15:53 PM**: The initial y-offset for `temperature_text` in its constructor call changes from `0.4f` to `1.5f`, then to `1.0f`.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:17:04 PM**: Vertical positioning of `location_text` and `symbol_text` is adjusted.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:22:21 PM**: A significant repositioning of all elements occurs. The `symbol` and `temperature_text` x-offsets are further refined (to `x - 0.1 * size` and `x + 0.1 * size` respectively). `location_text`, `time_text`, and `symbol_text` y-positions are all inverted relative to their previous `y` offsets, moving them from above `y` to below, or vice versa.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:24:37 PM**: Minor fine-tuning of `time_text`'s y-offset.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:24:46 PM**: The initial y-offset for `temperature_text` in its constructor changes to `0.f`, and the `symbol` zoom factor is further reduced to `0.6f`.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:24:56 PM**: The initial y-offset for `temperature_text` in its constructor changes to `0.8f`.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:27:52 PM**: Final fine-tuning of `symbol` and `temperature_text` x-offsets (to `x - 0.12 * size` and `x + 0.12 * size`).

The file `c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\Graph.cpp` defines a basic graph component.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:19:24 PM** establishes the `Graph` class constructor, which creates an LVGL line chart, sets its size to screen width + 100 pixels, centers it, and defines a Y-axis range from 0 to 100. It adds a red data series and populates it with 10 random values between 50 and 90 as example data. Placeholder functions `AddDataseries` and `ReplaceDataseries` are present, with the latter commented out.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:19:31 PM** and **3:27:58 PM**: No functional changes are observed, indicating minor re-saves.

The file `c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\BootScreen.cpp` defines a startup boot screen.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:59:13 PM** details the `BootScreen` class, which initializes an LVGL screen with a black background, a "Weather app" logo, version text "v1.0", and author text "Grupp 9". It implements two animations: a "drop" animation for the logo and a "flash" animation using a white overlay for visual effect, playing out over a 3-second period during device setup.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **LVGL UI Development**: All code changes are centered around developing a user interface using the LVGL library for embedded systems, likely on a LilyGo AMOLED display.
*   **Iterative UI Refinement**: There's a clear pattern of frequent, small adjustments to UI element positions and sizes (`WeatherForecastElement.cpp`) and label texts (`project.ino`), suggesting a detailed iterative design and debugging process to achieve the desired visual layout.
*   **Placeholder Data/Functionality**: Both the weather forecast elements and the graph utilize hardcoded or random data. The WiFi connection function is consistently commented out in `setup()`, and the `Dropdown` menu feature was introduced and then fully reverted, indicating that core data fetching and more complex interactive elements are either under active development, postponed, or being simulated.
*   **Modular Design**: The use of separate classes like `BootScreen`, `Graph`, `WeatherForecastElement`, and `Dropdown` (even if temporary) points to a modular, object-oriented approach to building the application.
