# Activity Summary for 12/1/2025

## 12:48:22 PM
The changes primarily involve two files: `arial_12.c` and `project.ino`, alongside the introduction of several other `arial_xx.c` font definition files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\Jespe\Downloads\arial_12.c` and `c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\fonts\arial_12.c` (Initial entries):**
    *   **Timestamp:** 12/1/2025, 12:09:17 PM (original download location) and 12/1/2025, 12:16:32 PM, 12:18:25 PM (moved to project fonts directory).
    *   **Content:** These files define the `arial_12` font for LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) at 12 pixels, 4 bits per pixel, without compression. They include glyph bitmap data for characters within the ASCII range 0-127, plus ÅåÄäÖö. The content remains identical across these first three entries, indicating a file movement or copy within the project structure rather than content modification.

2.  **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\project.ino` (Multiple entries from 12:21:12 PM to 12:46:00 PM):**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file is frequently modified between 12:21:12 PM and 12:46:00 PM.
    *   **Content:** This is the main Arduino sketch (`.ino` file).
        *   **12:21:12 PM:** An import `Dropdown.h` is duplicated. A `t1_label` and `t3_label` are declared but then `t1_label` is removed in subsequent versions. The `create_ui()` function is defined to set up a `lv_tileview` with three horizontal tiles (`t0`, `t1`, `t2`). Tile `t1` displays a 7-day weather forecast using `WeatherForecastElement` objects with hardcoded example values for "Karlskrona". Tile `t2` displays a `Linegraf` with hardcoded coordinate values for "Lund". Tile `t0` acts as a boot/info screen showing "Weather app v1.0" and "Grupp 9". A `SettingsScreen` is instantiated and listeners are added to update forecast element locations. The `setup()` function initializes the AMOLED display, `SMHIStationsAndParameters`, LVGL, displays a boot screen for 3 seconds, then connects to WiFi using `WiFiHandler`. It also includes SMHI API testing with a `buildURL` call and `httpsGetCSV`.
        *   **12:22:13 PM:** `t1_label` and `t3_label` declarations are removed. The code remains largely the same otherwise.
        *   **12:22:46 PM:** An empty `#include ""` line is added, indicating an incomplete or erroneous include attempt.
        *   **12:23:03 PM:** The empty include is replaced with `#include "fonts/arial_12"`. This attempts to include the `arial_12` font, but without the `.c` extension.
        *   **12:23:29 PM:** The incorrect `#include "fonts/arial_12"` is removed.
        *   **12:23:40 PM:** A `LV_FONT_DECLARE(arial_12);` line is added to declare the `arial_12` font, and `lv_obj_set_style_text_font(t0_text1, arial_12, 0);` is updated to `lv_obj_set_style_text_font(t0_text1, &arial_12, 0);` (passing address).
        *   **12:32:46 PM - 12:35:50 PM:** Minor text change in `t0_text1` from "v1.0" to "v1.0 åäö", suggesting testing of special characters with the custom font. The rest of the content remains consistent.
        *   **12:38:01 PM - 12:38:06 PM:** No discernible code changes from the previous entry; likely a save operation.
        *   **12:42:37 PM:** No discernible code changes from the previous entry; likely a save operation.
        *   **12:46:00 PM:** The `lv_obj_set_style_text_font(t0_text1, &arial_12, 0);` line, which was attempting to use the custom font, is removed. This suggests issues using `arial_12` directly in `project.ino`.

3.  **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\ScaleableLabel.cpp` (Two entries at 12:44:58 PM and 12:45:44 PM):**
    *   **Timestamp:** 12/1/2025, 12:44:58 PM and 12:45:44 PM.
    *   **Content:** This file defines a `ScaleableLabel` class.
        *   **12:44:58 PM:** Declares `LV_FONT_DECLARE` for `arial_12` through `arial_48`. The `SetSize` method uses a series of `if-else if` statements to assign fonts based on a `final_size` calculation, initially mixing `arial_xx` with `lv_font_montserrat_xx` (e.g., `&aril_48` (typo), `&lv_font_montserrat_44`).
        *   **12:45:44 PM:** Corrects the typo `&aril_48` to `&arial_48` and consistently uses `&arial_xx` for all custom font sizes in the `SetSize` method, replacing the `lv_font_montserrat_xx` references. This indicates the project intends to use its custom-generated Arial fonts across various sizes for `ScaleableLabel`.

4.  **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\fonts\arial_xx.c` (Multiple entries from 12:46:21 PM to 12:47:24 PM):**
    *   **Timestamp:** Rapidly added between 12:46:21 PM and 12:47:24 PM.
    *   **Content:** These files (`arial_16.c`, `arial_20.c`, `arial_24.c`, `arial_28.c`, `arial_32.c`, `arial_36.c`, `arial_40.c`, `arial_44.c`, `arial_48.c`) are all newly added C source files. Each defines a specific size of the Arial font (e.g., 16px, 20px, ..., 48px) for LVGL, following the same structure as `arial_12.c` with the `--size` option adjusted accordingly. They include raw glyph bitmap data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **LVGL Font Integration:** A significant pattern is the generation and integration of custom Arial fonts (`arial_12.c`, `arial_16.c`, etc.) for use with the LVGL graphics library. The header comments in these font files indicate they were generated using a tool with options like `--bpp 4 --size [px] --no-compress --stride 1 --align 1 --font ARIAL.TTF --symbols ÅåÄäÖö --range 0-127 --format lvgl -o arial_[px].c`.
*   **Rapid Iteration on `project.ino`:** There are numerous small, quick changes to `project.ino`, indicating active development, testing, and debugging, particularly around UI elements, font usage, and includes.
*   **UI Structure:** The `create_ui()` function in `project.ino` consistently sets up a tiled user interface with `t0`, `t1`, and `t2` tiles. `t1` is for forecast, `t2` for graphs, and `t0` for an introductory/boot screen.
*   **Hardcoded Data for Testing:** Both the weather forecast elements and the line graph in `project.ino` use hardcoded example values (e.g., temperatures, dates, locations like "Karlskrona", "Lund"), suggesting that dynamic data fetching might still be under development or being mocked for UI layout.
*   **WiFi Setup:** The `setup()` function consistently attempts to connect to a WiFi network with hardcoded credentials and displays status messages.
*   **SMHI API Interaction:** There's a section in `setup()` dedicated to testing SMHI API calls, building a URL for "lufttemperatur" in "karlskrona" and fetching CSV data.
*   **Font Management in `ScaleableLabel.cpp`:** The `ScaleableLabel` class demonstrates an attempt to dynamically select font sizes based on a `size` parameter, transitioning from `lv_font_montserrat_xx` to custom `arial_xx` fonts. This indicates a focus on adaptive text rendering.

**Summary of Key Changes:**

The primary development focus is on building a weather application UI using LVGL on a LilyGo AMOLED display. Initial changes involve setting up the basic tiled UI and integrating a `WiFiHandler` and SMHI API calls.

A significant shift occurs with the introduction and integration of custom Arial fonts in various sizes (12px to 48px). The `ScaleableLabel.cpp` file is updated to utilize these custom `arial_xx` fonts dynamically, indicating an effort to control font rendering more precisely across different UI elements and sizes. The main `project.ino` file shows attempts to directly include and declare these custom fonts, with some trial-and-error demonstrated by the temporary incorrect includes and removal of direct font styling using `arial_12`. The consistent addition of `arial_xx.c` files and the refinement of `ScaleableLabel.cpp` suggests a comprehensive move towards using a custom font family for the application's UI.

## 1:48:45 PM
The provided log details code changes across several C/C++ files related to a project for a LilyGo AMOLED device, focusing heavily on UI development with LVGL and weather data integration.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Jespe\Downloads\arial_12.c` (12/1/2025, 12:09:17 PM):** This file is an initial entry, containing generated C code for an Arial 12-pixel font, specifically for the LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library). It includes glyph bitmap data for ASCII characters and some extended Latin characters like ÅåÄäÖö. This file appears to be a direct output from a font generation tool.

*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\fonts\arial_12.c` (12/1/2025, 12:16:32 PM - 12:18:25 PM):** The `arial_12.c` file is moved or copied into the project's `fonts` directory. The content remains identical across these two timestamps, indicating initial placement or minor, unlogged changes.

*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\project.ino` (Multiple changes between 12/1/2025, 12:21:12 PM and 12:52:02 PM):**
    *   **Initial State (12:21:12 PM):** This is the main Arduino sketch. It includes numerous libraries for UI (LVGL, LilyGo AMOLED, Dropdown, Linegraf), networking (SMHIAPI, WiFiHandler), and application logic (BootScreen, Graph, WeatherForecastElement, SettingsScreen, SMHIStationsAndParameters). It defines a multi-tile UI (`tileview` with `t0`, `t1`, `t2`), including a 7-day weather forecast (with example values), a line graph, and an introductory tile. Wi-Fi connection is initiated in `setup()`, and SMHI API data retrieval is tested. Notably, Wi-Fi credentials are hardcoded in the `WiFiHandler` instantiation.
    *   **UI Cleanup (12:22:13 PM):** Unused UI variable declarations (`t1_label`, `t3_label`) are removed.
    *   **Font Integration Attempts (12:22:46 PM - 12:23:56 PM):** Several rapid changes occur to incorporate `arial_12` into the UI:
        *   An empty `#include ""` is briefly added (12:22:46 PM), then corrected to `#include "fonts/arial_12"` (12:23:03 PM) to include the font data.
        *   The font `arial_12` is then explicitly applied to `t0_text1` (the "v1.0" label).
        *   The `#include` is removed (12:23:29 PM), and instead, `LV_FONT_DECLARE(arial_12);` is added (12:23:40 PM), indicating a shift to declare the font symbol for linking rather than direct inclusion.
        *   The font assignment is corrected from `arial_12` to `&arial_12` (12:23:56 PM) as `lv_obj_set_style_text_font` expects a pointer.
        *   During this period, the `t0_text1` label text is temporarily changed to "v1.0 åäö" to test rendering of special characters (12:23:56 PM), then reverted back to "v1.0" (12:32:46 PM), and then back to "v1.0 åäö" (12:33:11 PM), suggesting debugging of these characters.
    *   **Final `project.ino` Font Adjustments (12:46:00 PM - 12:52:02 PM):** The specific font application for `t0_text1` (`LV_FONT_DECLARE(arial_12);` and `lv_obj_set_style_text_font(t0_text1, &arial_12, 0);`) is removed, and the `t0_text1` text is reverted to "v1.0". This suggests that the font handling might have been centralized or moved to other components (like `ScaleableLabel.cpp`).

*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\ScaleableLabel.cpp` (Multiple changes between 12/1/2025, 12:44:58 PM and 12:45:44 PM):**
    *   **New File (12:44:58 PM):** This file introduces a `ScaleableLabel` class designed to dynamically adjust font size. It declares multiple `arial` fonts (12-48 px). Its `SetSize` method contains logic to select a font based on a `final_size` calculation, initially using `lv_font_montserrat_XX` for most sizes and a typo `aril_48` for the largest.
    *   **Font System Refinement (12:45:44 PM):** The typo `aril_48` is corrected to `arial_48`. Critically, all `lv_font_montserrat_XX` references are replaced with their corresponding `arial_XX` fonts, indicating a full transition to custom Arial fonts for scalable labels.

*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\fonts\arial_XX.c` (Multiple additions between 12/1/2025, 12:46:21 PM and 12:47:24 PM):** New font definition files (`arial_16.c`, `arial_20.c`, `arial_24.c`, `arial_28.c`, `arial_32.c`, `arial_36.c`, `arial_40.c`, `arial_44.c`, `arial_48.c`) are added to the project. These files provide the necessary glyph bitmap data for the various Arial font sizes now referenced by `ScaleableLabel.cpp`. They are generated with similar parameters to `arial_12.c`, including support for Swedish special characters.

*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\src\lv_conf.h` (Multiple changes between 12/1/2025, 12:56:40 PM and 1:09:47 PM):** This LVGL configuration file remains consistent across all provided logs for it. Key configurations include 16-bit color depth, custom memory allocation using ESP32 PSRAM (`ps_malloc`), custom tick source using `millis()`, and enabled complex drawing features for gradients and rounded corners. The multiple timestamps suggest repeated saving without functional changes in the provided snippets.

*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\Dropdown.cpp` (Multiple changes between 12/1/2025, 12:59:42 PM and 1:05:11 PM):**
    *   **Initial Implementation (12:59:42 PM):** Introduces a `Dropdown` template class, responsible for creating and managing LVGL dropdown UI elements. It handles converting `std::vector` of choices into a displayable string. It initially attempts to apply `arial_12` and a problematic `pmod->gui.rus_font_12` font style to various parts of the dropdown, which would likely result in compilation errors due to undeclared variables.
    *   **Font Application Fix (12:59:59 PM):** Corrects the font style application by targeting `dropdownBox` directly with `arial_12` for `LV_PART_MAIN`, `LV_PART_SCROLLBAR`, and `LV_PART_SELECTED`, resolving the previous syntax errors.
    *   **Font Style Removal (1:05:11 PM):** All explicit font style applications (`lv_obj_add_style`) are removed from the `Dropdown` constructor. This suggests a decision to either rely on inherited styles or implement font styling elsewhere for dropdowns.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **12/1/2025, 12:21:12 PM:** Initial robust state of `project.ino` with UI, WiFi, and API integration.
*   **12/1/2025, 12:22:13 PM:** UI variable cleanup in `project.ino`.
*   **12/1/2025, 12:23:03 PM:** Successful inclusion of `arial_12.h` in `project.ino` for font use.
*   **12/1/2025, 12:23:40 PM - 12:23:56 PM:** Shift from direct font include to `LV_FONT_DECLARE` and correction of font pointer usage, along with special character testing in `project.ino`.
*   **12/1/2025, 12:44:58 PM:** Introduction of `ScaleableLabel.cpp` for dynamic font sizing.
*   **12/1/2025, 12:45:44 PM:** `ScaleableLabel.cpp` is updated to consistently use custom Arial fonts across all sizes, fixing a typo.
*   **12/1/2025, 12:46:00 PM:** Removal of direct font application in `project.ino`, possibly due to the `ScaleableLabel` component now handling font logic.
*   **12/1/2025, 12:46:21 PM - 12:47:24 PM:** Addition of multiple `arial_XX.c` font files, providing the necessary assets for the scalable font system.
*   **12/1/2025, 12:59:59 PM:** Fix to `Dropdown.cpp` for correctly applying `arial_12` font styles.
*   **12/1/2025, 1:05:11 PM:** Removal of explicit font styling in `Dropdown.cpp`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **LVGL UI Development:** The project heavily relies on LVGL for its graphical user interface, with frequent creation, styling, and event handling of LVGL objects like `tileview`, `labels`, and `dropdowns`.
*   **Custom Font Integration:** A prominent theme is the generation and integration of custom Arial fonts (`arial_12.c` through `arial_48.c`) to replace or augment default LVGL fonts, particularly for supporting special characters like `åäö` and enabling scalable text. This involves multiple iterations of including, declaring, and applying these fonts.
*   **Iterative Refinement and Debugging:** The rapid sequence of changes, including additions, removals, and corrections (especially for font handling in `project.ino` and `Dropdown.cpp`, and the `åäö` text testing), indicates an active development and debugging process to achieve desired UI behavior and aesthetics.
*   **Embedded System Context:** The use of `.ino` files, `LilyGo_AMOLED`, `ESP.getFreeHeap()`, `Serial.begin()`, and `ps_malloc` (for PSRAM) clearly points to development for an ESP32-based embedded system with a display.
*   **Weather Application Focus:** The code sets up a weather application, including components for displaying forecasts and graphs, and interacting with an SMHI API for data.
*   **Hardcoded Wi-Fi Credentials:** The Wi-Fi SSID and password appear directly in the `project.ino` file within the `WiFiHandler` instantiation across all its log entries.

## 2:50:29 PM
The log details development activities on an embedded weather application, primarily focusing on UI elements with LVGL, custom fonts, API integration, and weather data representation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Jespe\Downloads\arial_12.c` (12/1/2025, 12:09:17 PM):** This file was initially introduced as a generated LVGL font bitmap for Arial 12px, supporting basic ASCII and some Swedish characters (ÅåÄäÖö).
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\fonts\arial_12.c` (12/1/2025, 12:16:32 PM & 12:18:25 PM):** The `arial_12.c` font file was moved into the project's `fonts` directory.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\project.ino` (12/1/2025, 12:21:12 PM - 12:42:37 PM & 1:56:09 PM - 12:52:02 PM):** This main Arduino sketch saw extensive UI initialization and configuration.
    *   Initial setup included numerous LVGL-related includes (`TFT_eSPI`, `LilyGo_AMOLED`, `lvgl.h`, `LV_Helper.h`) along with project-specific components (`SMHIAPI.h`, `Dropdown.h`, `BootScreen.h`, `Graph.h`, `WeatherForecastElement.h`, `WiFiHandler.h`, `Linegraf.h`, `SettingsScreen.h`, `SMHIStationsAndParameters.h`).
    *   The UI structure was defined using LVGL tileviews (`t0`, `t1`, `t2`), setting up a 7-day weather forecast screen (`t1` using `WeatherForecastElement`) and a line graph display (`t2` using `Linegraf`).
    *   The boot sequence for the display and initial WiFi connection were established in `setup()`.
    *   Testing of SMHI API functions (`buildURL`, `httpsGetCSV`) was initially present but later commented out.
    *   WiFi credentials for the `WiFiHandler` were updated from `"OWNIT_5GHz_C1EB51"` to `"BTH_Guest"` and their respective passwords.
    *   Experimentation with integrating the `arial_12` font involved attempts to `#include` it directly, then declaring it with `LV_FONT_DECLARE`, and finally referencing its address. These changes were subsequently reverted for labels on the main screen (`t0_text1`), suggesting font management was centralized elsewhere.
    *   The `Linegraf` object initialization was refactored to use an `lv_obj_t` as a parent and provided an expanded set of coordinate data.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\ScaleableLabel.cpp` (12/1/2025, 12:44:58 PM & 12:45:44 PM):** A new `ScaleableLabel` class was introduced to manage LVGL labels with dynamic font sizing.
    *   It declared `LV_FONT_DECLARE` for a range of Arial font sizes (12px to 48px).
    *   The `SetSize` method was implemented to select an appropriate Arial font based on a calculated `final_size`, correcting an initial typo (`aril_48` to `arial_48`) and transitioning from `lv_font_montserrat_XX` to the custom `arial_XX` fonts.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\fonts\arial_16.c` to `arial_48.c` (12/1/2025, 12:46:21 PM - 12:47:24 PM):** Multiple new C files were added, each containing bitmap data for different sizes of the Arial font (16px, 20px, 24px, 28px, 32px, 36px, 40px, 44px, 48px). These were generated for LVGL, including support for Swedish characters.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\src\lv_conf.h` (12/1/2025, 12:56:40 PM - 1:09:47 PM):** This LVGL configuration file was updated to use custom memory allocation (`LV_MEM_CUSTOM 1`) with `ps_malloc`, `free`, and `ps_realloc` from `<esp32-hal-psram.h>`, indicating the project leverages PSRAM for memory management. Other core LVGL settings remained consistent.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\Dropdown.cpp` (12/1/2025, 12:59:42 PM - 1:05:11 PM):** A templated `Dropdown` class was implemented.
    *   It manages LVGL dropdowns, converting a `vector<T>` of choices into a displayable string.
    *   Initially, it attempted to apply `arial_12` and a `rus_font_12` (from an undeclared `pmod` object) to various parts of the dropdown. This was quickly corrected to apply `arial_12` to the `dropdownBox` itself.
    *   Later, the explicit font styling calls in the constructor were removed, possibly deferring styling to external stylesheets or parent objects.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\SMHIAPI\SMHIAPI.cpp` (12/1/2025, 1:59:57 PM - 2:07:17 PM):** This file provides functions for HTTPS communication with the SMHI API to fetch JSON and CSV data.
    *   It initializes a `WiFiClientSecure` with `setInsecure()` and includes functions for building SMHI API URLs, deserializing JSON, and retrieving specific weather parameters or city data.
    *   A notable change involved temporarily commenting out all its code (effectively disabling API calls) and then restoring it.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\SMHIAPI\SMHIAPI.h` (12/1/2025, 2:00:17 PM - 2:08:41 PM):** The header for `SMHIAPI.cpp`.
    *   It declared API constants and function prototypes. A syntax error with `buildURL` having a function body in the header was introduced and then corrected.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\WeatherCodeToSymbol.h` (12/1/2025, 2:11:08 PM - 2:34:49 PM):** This header file initially defined a `GetWeatherSymbol` function to map weather codes to LVGL image descriptors.
    *   It evolved from simple `&Sunny` placeholders to declaring a large set of Swedish-named weather image descriptors (e.g., `Åska`, `Dimma`, `Klart`, `Regn`, `Snöfall`).
    *   The `GetWeatherSymbol` function was progressively updated to map numerical weather codes to these specific image descriptors and eventually changed its input parameter type from `int` to `WeatherType`. This file was later effectively replaced by moving its content to `WeatherType.h`.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\WeatherForecastElement.cpp` (12/1/2025, 2:32:33 PM & 2:35:23 PM):** This class is responsible for displaying individual weather forecast elements on the UI.
    *   It creates and manages `ScaleableLabel` instances for temperature, location, time, and an LVGL image for the weather symbol.
    *   The logic to set the weather symbol was streamlined to call the `GetWeatherSymbol` function, and the redundant `switch` statement for `WeatherType` was removed. The dependency on `WeatherCodeToSymbol.h` was removed.
*   **`c:\C++Saker\projects\PA1484\PA1484\project\WeatherType.h` (12/1/2025, 2:35:15 PM - 2:46:02 PM):** This new header introduced an `enum class WeatherType` with a comprehensive list of weather conditions (e.g., `Clear`, `LightRainShowers`, `HeavySnow`).
    *   It initially duplicated the `LV_IMG_DECLARE` statements and `GetWeatherSymbol` function from `WeatherCodeToSymbol.h`, which would cause compilation conflicts.
    *   A `GetTypeName` static function was added to provide string representations for `WeatherType` enum values. This function underwent several iterations of corrections to accurately map all `WeatherType` enum members to their corresponding string names, resolving initial syntax and logical errors.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **12/1/2025, ~12:21 PM:** Initial comprehensive UI and system setup in `project.ino`.
*   **12/1/2025, ~12:23 PM:** Introduction and debugging of custom font usage (`arial_12`) in `project.ino`, including `LV_FONT_DECLARE`.
*   **12/1/2025, ~12:45 PM - 12:47 PM:** Introduction of `ScaleableLabel.cpp` and a full suite of custom Arial font sizes (12px to 48px) as separate `.c` files, indicating a move towards a flexible, custom typography system. `ScaleableLabel` was refactored to fully utilize these custom fonts.
*   **12/1/2025, ~12:56 PM:** Configuration of LVGL to use PSRAM for memory allocation in `lv_conf.h`, critical for resource-constrained embedded systems.
*   **12/1/2025, ~1:00 PM:** Refinement of the `Dropdown.cpp` class, specifically its font styling.
*   **12/1/2025, 1:56:09 PM:** A major update to `project.ino`, including changes to WiFi credentials, refactoring of graph object initialization, and commenting out the SMHI API test code.
*   **12/1/2025, ~2:00 PM - 2:08 PM:** Temporary commenting out and subsequent restoration of all API functionality in `SMHIAPI.cpp`, along with a critical syntax correction in `SMHIAPI.h`.
*   **12/1/2025, ~2:11 PM - 2:46 PM:** Rapid development and refinement of weather symbol and type handling across `WeatherCodeToSymbol.h`, `WeatherForecastElement.cpp`, and `WeatherType.h`. This included declaring numerous new weather image assets, implementing and then correcting comprehensive mappings from weather codes/types to both image descriptors and descriptive strings.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **LVGL-centric UI Development:** The project heavily relies on the LVGL graphics library, using its objects, styles, and event handling for all UI components.
*   **Iterative Refinement and Debugging:** Several file changes demonstrate an iterative development approach, with features being introduced, then refined, and bugs (like syntax errors, inconsistent font usage, or incorrect mappings) being identified and fixed in subsequent commits within a short timeframe.
*   **Custom Asset Integration:** There's a clear focus on integrating custom fonts (Arial in multiple sizes) and specific weather symbols (represented by Swedish terms) to enhance the visual presentation of the weather application.
*   **Embedded System Considerations:** The use of `esp32-hal-psram.h` for memory management highlights the project's targeting of ESP32 platforms, where efficient memory use is crucial.
*   **API Interaction:** The inclusion and active development of SMHI API interaction indicates a core functionality of fetching real-time weather data.
*   **Weather Application Logic:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around structuring weather data (e.g., `WeatherType` enum) and dynamically displaying it (e.g., `WeatherForecastElement`, `GetWeatherSymbol`, `GetTypeName`).
